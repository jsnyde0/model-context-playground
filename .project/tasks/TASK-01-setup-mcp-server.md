# Task: Setup Basic MCP Server Structure using SDK

- **Unique Task ID:** TASK-01-setup-mcp-server
- **Description:** Create the basic project structure and initial files for the MCP server component **using the `modelcontextprotocol` Python SDK directly within the main package (`playground/mcp_server.py`)**. This includes setting up the main server file using `FastMCP`, adding the SDK as a dependency, and ensuring it can run locally via the `mcp` CLI or `uv run`. This task primarily addresses Req 1.1.
- **Relevant Specification:** [.project/specs/SPEC-01-simple-math-agent-mcp.md](.project/specs/SPEC-01-simple-math-agent-mcp.md) (Specifically Requirement 1.1)
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
    - The MCP server code exists in `playground/mcp_server.py`.
    - The `mcp` package is added as a project dependency (e.g., in `pyproject.toml`).
    - A basic MCP server using `FastMCP` is implemented in `playground/mcp_server.py`.
    - The server can be started locally (e.g., via `uv run playground.mcp_server:mcp` or `mcp dev playground/mcp_server.py`).
    - The server initializes successfully without errors. (We'll add a specific tool endpoint in the next task).
- **Tests:**
    - N/A for this setup task, tests will be added when implementing the 'add' tool in the next task.
- **Metadata:**
    - **ID:** TASK-01-setup-mcp-server
    - **Start Date:** 2024-07-26
    - **End Date:** 2024-07-26
    - **State:** closed
    - **Estimated Lines of Code:** ~10-20
- **Complexity:** Low
- **Learnings:**
    - Used `mcp` Python SDK (`FastMCP`) for basic server setup.
    - Added SDK dependency via `uv add mcp`.
    - Refactored structure: package flattened and renamed to `playground`, server code moved to `playground/mcp_server.py`.
    - `mcp dev` starts an inspector; accessing its URL gives "Cannot GET /", which is expected for browser access.
    - Must use `uv run mcp dev ...` (or `uv run python ...`) to execute commands from the virtual environment.
    - Server path is `playground/mcp_server.py`.
